# Brainnest Front-End Development Course
## Week 1: HTML Site

A Guide to my taste in music, including my top five albums and artists, a short history of both heavy metal and electronic music, and some of my favourite reference books on the subject.

This site was created as an introductory assignment for the Brainnest Frontend Development Course, and so is a HTML site only.
